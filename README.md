[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-certgram.vercel.app-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://certgram.vercel.app/)  

This project was created as my **Web Design I Final Project**.  
It’s a responsive grid layout demo built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that adapts seamlessly across **desktop, tablet, and mobile** views.  
Users can toggle layouts with a simple header control, showcasing how components rearrange and scale at different breakpoints.
